Hello, from a newb to github, I've been coding mainly html, css, and vba for MS access and excel, having learned basic c, cobol, visual basic and java (to a greater extent). Having always appreciated the open source ethos, I've also some very rudimentary knowledge of php, apache and mysql although following difficulties getting these working in conjunction with one another some years back,(never getting the contents of the mySQL database to diplay in an .php/html page. I then experienced a major disk failure (and frustratingly having no backup of the recently downloaded software) have found little time since to recombine these elements into producing more dynamic web content using the AMP of LAMP.

I am currently revising a website written for another domain some years ago which employed a form and javascript to extract the information entered (some 15+ items) and post this to an email address. However the web hosting provider now uses Exchange as the email server and this now requires additional authentication to send the email. I have been recommended by them to use PHPMailer and subsequently came across GitHub hence my arrival here...
